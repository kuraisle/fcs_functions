A collection of functions for plotting and fitting FCS data

This package allows you to import Zeiss FCS files, both .raw and .fcs.
Once you've imported them, there are methods to render nice (or at least I think so) plots. I've also specified 3D diffusion models, so if you want to fit your data to a model, you can do that too. If you like jupyter notebooks and fcs, this might be the package for you!

I wanted three things:
1. To make my own plots of my FCS data
2. To understand the details of FCS better
3. To learn more about python by implementing my own classes and packaging my code


* Free software: MIT license
* Documentation: https://fcs-functions.readthedocs.io. (Yet to be added, apologies)


Features
--------

* TODO
        * Implement a class for a whole experiment
        * Work on a JIT compiled multiple tau correlator
        * Add capability for plotting and fitting PCH
        * Add other file formats
